Explain:

Problem domain (why chosen).

Definitions of InitialState, Actions, Transition, GoalTest, StepCost, Heuristics.

Search algorithm implementation details.

Heuristic proofs/arguments:

h0: trivial zero heuristic (UCS).

h1: admissible + consistent (with reasoning).

h2: either stronger admissible or an inadmissible exploratory heuristic.
